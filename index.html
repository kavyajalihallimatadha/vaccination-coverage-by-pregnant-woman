    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The dataset used in this study was sourced from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through their open data platform (data.cdc.gov). The dataset is titled:

“Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women” 
(Source: CDC PRAMS – Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System)

The CDC collects this data annually through surveys of postpartum women across multiple U.S. states. Survey participants self-report whether they received key maternal vaccines during pregnancy, including:

Influenza Vaccine (Flu)

Tdap Vaccine (Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis)

The CDC dataset includes several variables that describe vaccination rates across demographic and geographic segments. These attributes include:

Vaccine Type (Influenza or Tdap)

Geography Type (National or State)

Geography (50 U.S. states + the national aggregate)

Survey Year / Influenza Season (2012–2022)

Dimension Type (Age Group, Race & Ethnicity)

Dimension Category (e.g., 25–34 Years, Hispanic, Black Non-Hispanic)

Coverage Estimate (%)

95% Confidence Interval for the estimate

Sample Size

This dataset is widely used in maternal health surveillance, epidemiology, and vaccine trend research. The data is public, cleaned, and documented by the CDC, ensuring it is reliable for analytical and machine learning purposes.</p>
