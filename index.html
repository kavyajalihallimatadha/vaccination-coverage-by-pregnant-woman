    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different stages in the data science lifecycle. 
        Data science is a structured process that allows us to extract meaningful insights from data, and this tutorial focuses on four key stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering relevant datasets from reliable sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Cleaning and preparing the data to make it suitable for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization:</strong> Examining the data, identifying patterns, trends, and visualizing them for better understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation of Results:</strong> Drawing conclusions from the analysis and understanding what the results indicate about the underlying trends.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The overall aim of this data science cycle is to collect data, identify demands and trends, conduct exploratory data analysis, 
        and interpret the findings. While the results of this tutorial may not be fully conclusive, the process provides a clear understanding 
        of how data science works in practice. It also highlights the critical role that data science plays across various sectors, including healthcare, 
        industries, finance, and more. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For this tutorial, I have chosen a dataset from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. The dataset focuses on vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the United States. 
        By using this dataset, I aim to understand and analyze vaccination trends, explore sociodemographic variations, and learn how data science 
        can be applied to real-world healthcare problems. This hands-on exercise helps to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

<section id="data-collection">
    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The dataset used in this study was sourced from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through their open data platform (data.cdc.gov). The dataset is titled:

“Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women” 
(Source: CDC PRAMS – Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System)

The CDC collects this data annually through surveys of postpartum women across multiple U.S. states. Survey participants self-report whether they received key maternal vaccines during pregnancy, including:

Influenza Vaccine (Flu)

Tdap Vaccine (Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis)

The CDC dataset includes several variables that describe vaccination rates across demographic and geographic segments. These attributes include:

Vaccine Type (Influenza or Tdap)

Geography Type (National or State)

Geography (50 U.S. states + the national aggregate)

Survey Year / Influenza Season (2012–2022)

Dimension Type (Age Group, Race & Ethnicity)

Dimension Category (e.g., 25–34 Years, Hispanic, Black Non-Hispanic)

Coverage Estimate (%)

95% Confidence Interval for the estimate

Sample Size

This dataset is widely used in maternal health surveillance, epidemiology, and vaccine trend research. The data is public, cleaned, and documented by the CDC, ensuring it is reliable for analytical and machine learning purposes.</p>
