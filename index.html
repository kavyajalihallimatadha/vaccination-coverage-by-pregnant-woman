    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different stages in the data science lifecycle. 
        Data science is a structured process that allows us to extract meaningful insights from data, and this tutorial focuses on four key stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Model Analysis:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation of Results:</strong> </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    The overall aim of this data science cycle is to collect data, identify demands and trends, conduct exploratory data analysis, 
    and interpret the findings. While the results of this tutorial may not be fully conclusive, the process provides a clear understanding 
    of how data science works in practice. It also highlights the critical role that data science plays across various sectors, including healthcare, 
    industries, finance, and more. Data-driven decision-making has become a cornerstone in modern industries, and understanding how to handle, analyze, 
    and visualize data effectively is a crucial skill for any aspiring data scientist.
</p>
<p>
    For this tutorial, I have chosen a dataset from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. The dataset focuses on vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the United States. 
    Vaccination during pregnancy is an important public health concern, as it helps protect both the mother and the baby from preventable diseases. 
    Analyzing this dataset allows us to understand patterns of vaccine uptake, explore disparities across different age groups and ethnicities, 
    and identify states or regions where coverage may be lower. These insights can help public health professionals and policymakers design 
    interventions to improve vaccination rates.
</p>
<p>
    By working with this dataset, I aim to gain hands-on experience with real-world data. The process involves handling raw data that may contain 
    inconsistencies, missing values, or different formats, which is typical in practical data science projects. This tutorial demonstrates how 
    cleaning and preprocessing are essential to prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring that the results are accurate and meaningful. 
    Additionally, performing exploratory data analysis and visualizations helps to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers that might otherwise 
    go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the technical aspects, this exercise emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of the data. In healthcare, for instance, 
    analyzing vaccination coverage provides actionable insights that can influence public health policies, resource allocation, and community outreach programs. 
    Data science is not just about building models or computing statistics; it is about deriving knowledge that can lead to real-world impact. 
    Through this tutorial, I also learned how data science methodologies can be applied in different sectors, illustrating the versatility and relevance of 
    data-driven approaches in solving practical problems.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, this tutorial offers a holistic view of the data science lifecycle, from data collection to result interpretation. 
    Even though the outcomes of the analysis may vary or have limitations due to the dataset size, structure, or quality, the learning gained is invaluable. 
    It provides a foundation for further exploration, experimentation, and application of data science techniques in both academic and professional settings. 
    By completing this exercise, I now have a deeper appreciation of the iterative and structured approach required in data science projects, 
    and I am better prepared to apply these skills to future datasets and research questions.

<section id="data-collection">
    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The dataset used in this study was sourced from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through their open data platform (data.cdc.gov). The dataset is titled:

“Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women” 
(Source: CDC PRAMS – Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System)

The CDC collects this data annually through surveys of postpartum women across multiple U.S. states. Survey participants self-report whether they received key maternal vaccines during pregnancy, including:

Influenza Vaccine (Flu)

Tdap Vaccine (Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis)

The CDC dataset includes several variables that describe vaccination rates across demographic and geographic segments. These attributes include:

Vaccine Type (Influenza or Tdap)

Geography Type (National or State)

Geography (50 U.S. states + the national aggregate)

Survey Year / Influenza Season (2012–2022)

Dimension Type (Age Group, Race & Ethnicity)

Dimension Category (e.g., 25–34 Years, Hispanic, Black Non-Hispanic)

Coverage Estimate (%)

95% Confidence Interval for the estimate

Sample Size

This dataset is widely used in maternal health surveillance, epidemiology, and vaccine trend research. The data is public, cleaned, and documented by the CDC, ensuring it is reliable for analytical and machine learning purposes.</p>
