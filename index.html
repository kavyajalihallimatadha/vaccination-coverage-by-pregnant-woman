    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different stages in the data science lifecycle. 
        Data science is a structured process that allows us to extract meaningful insights from data, and this tutorial focuses on four key stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Model Analysis</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation of Results</strong> </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    The overall aim of this data science cycle is to collect data, identify demands and trends, conduct exploratory data analysis, 
    and interpret the findings. While the results of this tutorial may not be fully conclusive, the process provides a clear understanding 
    of how data science works in practice. It also highlights the critical role that data science plays across various sectors, including healthcare, 
    industries, finance, and more. Data-driven decision-making has become a cornerstone in modern industries, and understanding how to handle, analyze, 
    and visualize data effectively is a crucial skill for any aspiring data scientist.
</p>
<p>
    For this tutorial, I have chosen a dataset from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. The dataset focuses on vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the United States. 
    Vaccination during pregnancy is an important public health concern, as it helps protect both the mother and the baby from preventable diseases. 
    Analyzing this dataset allows us to understand patterns of vaccine uptake, explore disparities across different age groups and ethnicities, 
    and identify states or regions where coverage may be lower. These insights can help public health professionals and policymakers design 
    interventions to improve vaccination rates.
</p>
<p>
    By working with this dataset, I aim to gain hands-on experience with real-world data. The process involves handling raw data that may contain 
    inconsistencies, missing values, or different formats, which is typical in practical data science projects. This tutorial demonstrates how 
    cleaning and preprocessing are essential to prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring that the results are accurate and meaningful. 
    Additionally, performing exploratory data analysis and visualizations helps to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers that might otherwise 
    go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the technical aspects, this exercise emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of the data. In healthcare, for instance, 
    analyzing vaccination coverage provides actionable insights that can influence public health policies, resource allocation, and community outreach programs. 
    Data science is not just about building models or computing statistics; it is about deriving knowledge that can lead to real-world impact. 
    Through this tutorial, I also learned how data science methodologies can be applied in different sectors, illustrating the versatility and relevance of 
    data-driven approaches in solving practical problems.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, this tutorial offers a holistic view of the data science lifecycle, from data collection to result interpretation. 
    Even though the outcomes of the analysis may vary or have limitations due to the dataset size, structure, or quality, the learning gained is invaluable. 
    It provides a foundation for further exploration, experimentation, and application of data science techniques in both academic and professional settings. 
    By completing this exercise, I now have a deeper appreciation of the iterative and structured approach required in data science projects, 
    and I am better prepared to apply these skills to future datasets and research questions.

<section id="data-collection">
    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>

    <p>
        The first and most essential step in any data science project is <strong>Data Collection</strong>. 
        The quality, completeness, and relevance of the data directly influence the accuracy, reliability, 
        and overall usefulness of the insights we can derive. Depending on the nature of the project, 
        data may originate from several different sources, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Web scraping from publicly accessible websites or portals.</li>
        <li>Downloading datasets from trusted repositories, open data platforms, or government databases.</li>
        <li>Data generated from internal systems, experiments, surveys, or simulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For this project, the dataset was obtained directly from the 
        <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. 
        The dataset focuses specifically on <strong>vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the United States</strong>. 
        Since it is well-organized and contains a substantial number of observations across multiple years, states, 
        and demographic categories, it provides a strong foundation for meaningful analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Effective data collection is not just about acquiring large datasets—what matters most is that the data is 
        <strong>relevant, complete, and reliable</strong>. A well-collected dataset forms the basis for subsequent 
        stages of the data science lifecycle, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and interpretation.
    </p>

    <h3>Importing Python Libraries</h3>
    <p>
        After acquiring the dataset, the next step is to import the essential Python libraries. 
        Python provides a powerful ecosystem for data science, offering libraries for data manipulation, visualization, 
        and machine learning. The following image shows the key libraries imported for this project:
    </p>
    <img src="Untitled.png" alt="Library Imports" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">

    <h3>Download and Import the Data</h3>
    <p>
        Once the CSV file has been downloaded from the CDC platform, it should be placed in the same directory as your 
        Python script or Jupyter Notebook. This ensures that the file can be easily accessed and loaded into a pandas DataFrame 
        for analysis.
    </p>
    <img src="Untitled1.png" alt="Data Loading" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">

    <h3>Understanding the Data</h3>
    <p>
        Before performing any transformations or analysis, it is important to first understand the structure of the dataset. 
        Each row represents a single observation, while each column corresponds to a specific variable, such as year, state, 
        demographic group, or vaccination estimate. Exploring the dataset ensures that decisions in later stages—such as cleaning, 
        modeling, or interpreting results—are based on a solid understanding of the underlying data.

<section id="data-cleaning">
    <h2>3. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</h2> 
    <p> Once the dataset was successfully loaded, the next stage in the data science lifecycle involved cleaning the data and 
        performing exploratory analysis. Data cleaning is an essential part of any data project because raw data is often incomplete, 
        inconsistent, or difficult to analyze in its original form. Cleaning the data prepares it for reliable analysis and ensures that
        any insights or predictions derived from it are accurate and meaningful. </p> <p> Data cleaning usually involves several tasks, 
            such as removing unnecessary information, handling missing values, fixing formatting issues, and transforming variables into 
            formats that are easier to work with. In this project, the data cleaning process consisted of the following key steps: </p>
    <ul> <li> <strong>Identifying Missing and Inconsistent Data:</strong><br> The dataset contained missing values in columns such as
        <em>Sample Size</em> and <em>Coverage Estimate</em>. The <em>95% CI</em> column also had non-numeric values like <strong>NR</strong>
        and <strong>NR*</strong>.
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"> 
            <img src="Untitled3.png"> </div> <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="Untitled4.png"> </div> <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"> 
                    <img src="Untitled5.png"> </div>
    </li>
        <li> <strong>Renaming Columns for Better Readability:</strong><br> Some column names were long or unclear, so they were renamed
            to more readable labels.
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="Untitled6.png"> </div> </li>
        <li> <strong>Handling Missing Values with Median Imputation:</strong><br> 
            The <strong>median</strong> was used to fill missing
                values because it is more robust to outliers.
            <em>Sample Size</em> missing values were filled with the median.
                    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled7.png"> </div>
                 <em>Coverage Estimate</em> missing values were also filled using the median.
                    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled8.png"> </div>
                
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Dropping Invalid Confidence Interval Rows:</strong><br> Rows with <strong>NR</strong> or <strong>NR*</strong> in the <em>95% CI</em> column were removed. <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled9.png"> </div> </li> </ul> <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3> <p> After cleaning the dataset, we conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the key patterns and distributions that shape vaccination coverage among pregnant women across the United States. EDA helps us uncover trends, detect inconsistencies, compare demographic groups, and identify the factors that appear to influence vaccination behavior. These insights guided our modeling decisions and provided important context for interpreting results later in the project. </p> <h3>3.1 Overview and Summary Statistics</h3> <p> The dataset contains <strong>4,322 observations</strong> across multiple states, years, and demographic groups, covering two important maternal vaccines: <strong>Influenza</strong> and <strong>Tdap</strong>. Summary statistics reveal that vaccination coverage estimates range widely—from as low as <strong>5.2%</strong> to nearly <strong>99.6%</strong>. This large spread suggests that vaccination behaviors vary substantially across different groups and locations. </p> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled10.png"> </div> <p> The most frequent demographic category in the dataset is <strong>25–34 Years</strong>, and the most common geography is <strong>Wisconsin</strong>. The survey years span from <strong>2012 to 2022</strong>, providing a decade-long view of trends. </p> <h3>3.2 Vaccine Distribution</h3> <p> The dataset contains nearly twice as many records for <strong>Influenza</strong> (2,865) compared to <strong>Tdap</strong> (1,457). This difference reflects a broader availability and longer history of flu vaccine reporting among pregnant women. </p> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled11.png"> </div> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled15.png"> </div> <p> When comparing vaccination estimates between the two vaccines, Influenza shows a higher and more consistent coverage distribution. Tdap coverage tends to be lower and more variable, suggesting either lower uptake or differences in reporting across states and years. </p> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled29.png" > </div> <h3>3.3 Geographic Distribution</h3> <p> Most entries in the dataset are state-level records (<strong>4,146</strong>), with only <strong>176</strong> national-level entries. This means state differences play a major role in shaping overall trends, and geographical variations are an important factor to explore. </p> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled12.png"> </div> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled30.png"> </div> <h3>3.4 Demographic Dimension Analysis</h3> <p> The dataset includes two main dimension types: <strong>Age</strong> and <strong>Race/Ethnicity</strong>, each providing important insights into vaccination gaps or strengths. Among all dimension categories, the highest representation comes from: </p> <ul> <li>25–34 Years</li> <li>≥18 Years</li> <li>White, Non-Hispanic</li> <li>Hispanic</li> <li>Black, Non-Hispanic</li> </ul> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled31.png"> </div> <p> Coverage differences between <strong>Age</strong> and <strong>Race/Ethnicity</strong> groups reveal interesting patterns—age groups tend to show higher consistency, while racial and ethnic categories show more variability. </p> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled32.png" > </div> <h3>3.5 Age Group Vaccination Patterns</h3> <p> When examining age groups specifically, a clear pattern emerges: the <strong>25–34 Years</strong> group consistently displays higher vaccination coverage for both vaccines, while the <strong>18–24 Years</strong> group generally shows lower coverage. These differences may reflect varying levels of healthcare access, prenatal care engagement, or awareness. </p> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled33.png"> </div> <h3>3.6 Yearly Coverage Trends (2012–2022)</h3> <p> A decade-long trend analysis shows a gradual increase in vaccination coverage for both Influenza and Tdap. Coverage rises steadily until around <strong>2019</strong>, followed by slight fluctuations during 2020–2022—likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted healthcare access and introduced new vaccination priorities. </p> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled18.png"> </div> <h3>3.7 State-Level Insights</h3> <p> Excluding national-level data, the top 5 states with the most available records are: </p> <ul> <li>Wisconsin</li> <li>Delaware</li> <li>Pennsylvania</li> <li>NY–City of New York</li> <li>Missouri</li> </ul> <p> These states provide substantial data for deeper state-level trend analysis. On average, vaccination coverage varies widely across these states, and some exhibit more stable upward trends over time than others. </p> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled19.png"> </div> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled20.png"> </div> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled22.png"> </div> <div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;"> <img src="Untitled34.png"> </div> </section>



<section id="model-training">
    <h2>4. Model Training and Testing</h2>
    <p>
        After completing the data cleaning and exploratory analysis, the next step in the data science workflow 
        involved building predictive models to estimate vaccination coverage. 
        The objective of this stage was to determine whether vaccination rates among pregnant women can be 
        predicted using demographic, geographic, and temporal variables such as vaccine type, state, age group, 
        and survey year.
    </p>
    

    <h3>Data Preparation for Modeling</h3>
    <p>
        Since machine learning models require numerical values, all categorical columns 
        (such as <em>VACCINE</em>, <em>GEOGRAPHY</em>, <em>DIMENSION</em>, etc.) 
        were converted into numerical labels using <strong>Label Encoding</strong>. 
        This transformed the dataset into a form that could be processed by machine learning algorithms 
        without losing the underlying categorical relationships.
    </p>
     <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled23.png">
    </div>

    <p>
        The input features included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>VACCINE</strong> (Influenza or Tdap)</li>
        <li><strong>GEOGRAPHY</strong> (State/National)</li>
        <li><strong>GEOGRAPHY-TYPE</strong></li>
        <li><strong>DIMENSION-TYPE</strong> (Age or Race/Ethnicity)</li>
        <li><strong>DIMENSION</strong> (Specific age group or demographic group)</li>
        <li><strong>SURVEY-YEAR</strong> (2012–2022)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The target variable was the <strong>ESTIMATE</strong>, 
        which represents the vaccination coverage percentage.
    </p>
 <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled24.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        The dataset was then split into <strong>80% training data</strong> and 
        <strong>20% testing data</strong> using the <em>train_test_split</em> method. 
        This ensured fair evaluation by training the model on one portion of the data and testing it on unseen values.
    </p>
     <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled25.png">
    </div>

    <h3>Model 1: Linear Regression</h3>
    <p>
        The first model applied was a <strong>Linear Regression</strong> model. 
        This simple model attempts to describe the relationship between predictors and vaccination coverage 
        through a straight-line equation. 
        While linear models are easy to interpret, they may not fully capture complex nonlinear relationships 
        present in public health data.
    </p>
     <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled26.png">
    </div>

    <p>The Linear Regression model produced the following performance metrics:</p>
    <ul>
         <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled27.png">
    </div>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Model 2: Random Forest Regressor</h3>
    <p>
        To improve predictive performance, a <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong> 
        was trained. This model uses multiple decision trees and combines their outputs, 
        making it capable of capturing complex patterns, nonlinear interactions, 
        and variations in the dataset.
    </p>

    <p>The Random Forest model achieved significantly better results:</p>
    <ul>
       <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled28.png">
    </div>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These metrics indicate that the Random Forest model explains approximately 
        <strong>80% of the variation</strong> in vaccination coverage data, 
        making it a strong predictive model compared to Linear Regression. 
        The model successfully leveraged demographic, geographic, and temporal factors 
        to produce more accurate predictions.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="interpretation">
    <h2>5. Interpretation of Results</h2>
    <p>
        The results obtained from the two machine learning models provide important insights into the 
        predictability of vaccination coverage among pregnant women. By examining the performance metrics 
        and comparing both models, we can understand how well different demographic and geographic factors 
        contribute to predicting vaccination rates.
    </p>

    <h3>Model Performance Comparison</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>Linear Regression</strong> model delivered modest performance, with an R² score of 0.27. 
        This indicates that the linear model could only explain about 27% of the variance in vaccination coverage. 
        The relatively high MAE value (9.79) suggests that its predictions deviated from the actual coverage values 
        by nearly 10 percentage points on average. 
        This outcome reflects the limitations of linear models when the data contains nonlinear interactions, 
        such as varying demographic patterns and state-specific differences.
    </p>

    <p>
        In contrast, the <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong> demonstrated much stronger predictive capability. 
        With an R² score of 0.80, the model was able to explain 80% of the variability in the dataset, 
        showing that vaccination rates can be predicted effectively using factors such as demographic group, 
        vaccine type, and survey year. The MAE dropped to 5.11, meaning predictions were much closer to the 
        actual values.
    </p>

    <h3>Insights from the Modeling Process</h3>
    <p>
        Several meaningful insights emerge from these results:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Vaccination coverage is influenced by demographic and geographic factors.</strong><br>
            Differences between age groups, racial/ethnic groups, and states contribute significantly to the model’s predictive ability.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Year-to-year changes matter.</strong><br>
            The survey year has predictive power, likely due to policy changes, awareness campaigns, and 
            public health interventions over time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Nonlinear models capture complex patterns better.</strong><br>
            The large difference between Linear Regression and Random Forest performance shows that vaccination behavior 
            is not linear and requires more flexible modeling techniques.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overall Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
        The modeling results demonstrate that vaccination coverage among pregnant women can be 
        predicted with relatively high accuracy using key variables in the dataset. 
        The Random Forest model, in particular, highlights the strong influence of demographic factors 
        and geographic differences on vaccination behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        These findings emphasize how machine learning can support public health planning by identifying 
        which groups may need more targeted communication, outreach, or vaccination programs. 
        Although no predictive model is perfect, the results indicate that data-driven approaches 
        can effectively guide decision-making in maternal health and vaccination initiatives.
    </p>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        While our predictive models were not perfect, they provided meaningful insights into vaccination 
        coverage among pregnant women in the United States. Through this project, we were able to uncover 
        patterns in the data, clean and prepare the dataset, visualize important trends, test hypotheses, 
        and build models capable of estimating vaccination rates based on demographic and geographic factors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the Random Forest model performed well, we are not yet ready to recommend any major public 
        health decisions solely based on these predictions. Instead, the results highlight areas for further 
        exploration and point toward the need for additional data and more advanced modeling techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
        We hope this project has demonstrated each step of the data science lifecycle, including:
