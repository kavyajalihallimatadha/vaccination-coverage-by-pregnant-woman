    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different stages in the data science lifecycle. 
        Data science is a structured process that allows us to extract meaningful insights from data, and this tutorial focuses on four key stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Model Analysis</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation of Results</strong> </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    The overall aim of this data science cycle is to collect data, identify demands and trends, conduct exploratory data analysis, 
    and interpret the findings. While the results of this tutorial may not be fully conclusive, the process provides a clear understanding 
    of how data science works in practice. It also highlights the critical role that data science plays across various sectors, including healthcare, 
    industries, finance, and more. Data-driven decision-making has become a cornerstone in modern industries, and understanding how to handle, analyze, 
    and visualize data effectively is a crucial skill for any aspiring data scientist.
</p>
<p>
    For this tutorial, I have chosen a dataset from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. The dataset focuses on vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the United States. 
    Vaccination during pregnancy is an important public health concern, as it helps protect both the mother and the baby from preventable diseases. 
    Analyzing this dataset allows us to understand patterns of vaccine uptake, explore disparities across different age groups and ethnicities, 
    and identify states or regions where coverage may be lower. These insights can help public health professionals and policymakers design 
    interventions to improve vaccination rates.
</p>
<p>
    By working with this dataset, I aim to gain hands-on experience with real-world data. The process involves handling raw data that may contain 
    inconsistencies, missing values, or different formats, which is typical in practical data science projects. This tutorial demonstrates how 
    cleaning and preprocessing are essential to prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring that the results are accurate and meaningful. 
    Additionally, performing exploratory data analysis and visualizations helps to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers that might otherwise 
    go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the technical aspects, this exercise emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of the data. In healthcare, for instance, 
    analyzing vaccination coverage provides actionable insights that can influence public health policies, resource allocation, and community outreach programs. 
    Data science is not just about building models or computing statistics; it is about deriving knowledge that can lead to real-world impact. 
    Through this tutorial, I also learned how data science methodologies can be applied in different sectors, illustrating the versatility and relevance of 
    data-driven approaches in solving practical problems.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, this tutorial offers a holistic view of the data science lifecycle, from data collection to result interpretation. 
    Even though the outcomes of the analysis may vary or have limitations due to the dataset size, structure, or quality, the learning gained is invaluable. 
    It provides a foundation for further exploration, experimentation, and application of data science techniques in both academic and professional settings. 
    By completing this exercise, I now have a deeper appreciation of the iterative and structured approach required in data science projects, 
    and I am better prepared to apply these skills to future datasets and research questions.

<section id="data-collection">
    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The first and essential step in any data science project is Data collection. The quality and volume of the data we work with 
        directly influence the accuracy and usefulness of the results. Data can be collected from a variety of sources depending on the project 
        requirements. Common sources include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web scraping from publicly available websites or portals.</li>
        <li>Downloading datasets from reliable repositories, open data platforms, or government databases.</li>
        <li>Data generated from internal systems, experiments, or code simulations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For this tutorial, I have chosen to download the dataset and loaded it from my local system. The dataset focuses on vaccination coverage among pregnant 
        women in the United States and was obtained from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. By using a dataset that is well-structured and has a satisfactory volume of data, 
        we can ensure that the subsequent analysis and modeling will yield meaningful insights. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Collecting a good dataset is not just about the number of records but also about its completeness, relevance, and reliability. A well-collected 
        dataset forms the foundation for the next stages in the data science lifecycle, including data processing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.
    </p>
    <h3>Importing Python Libraries</h3>
    <p>
        Once the dataset is available, the next step is to import the necessary Python libraries. Python provides a rich ecosystem of libraries 
        that enable us to efficiently process, analyze, and visualize data.
    </p>
      <p>
        Some of the key libraries that will be used include:
