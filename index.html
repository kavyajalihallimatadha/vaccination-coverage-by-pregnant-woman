    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different stages in the data science lifecycle. 
        Data science is a structured process that allows us to extract meaningful insights from data, and this tutorial focuses on four key stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Model Analysis</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation of Results</strong> </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    The overall aim of this data science cycle is to collect data, identify demands and trends, conduct exploratory data analysis, 
    and interpret the findings. While the results of this tutorial may not be fully conclusive, the process provides a clear understanding 
    of how data science works in practice. It also highlights the critical role that data science plays across various sectors, including healthcare, 
    industries, finance, and more. Data-driven decision-making has become a cornerstone in modern industries, and understanding how to handle, analyze, 
    and visualize data effectively is a crucial skill for any aspiring data scientist.
</p>
<p>
    For this tutorial, I have chosen a dataset from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. The dataset focuses on vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the United States. 
    Vaccination during pregnancy is an important public health concern, as it helps protect both the mother and the baby from preventable diseases. 
    Analyzing this dataset allows us to understand patterns of vaccine uptake, explore disparities across different age groups and ethnicities, 
    and identify states or regions where coverage may be lower. These insights can help public health professionals and policymakers design 
    interventions to improve vaccination rates.
</p>
<p>
    By working with this dataset, I aim to gain hands-on experience with real-world data. The process involves handling raw data that may contain 
    inconsistencies, missing values, or different formats, which is typical in practical data science projects. This tutorial demonstrates how 
    cleaning and preprocessing are essential to prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring that the results are accurate and meaningful. 
    Additionally, performing exploratory data analysis and visualizations helps to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers that might otherwise 
    go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the technical aspects, this exercise emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of the data. In healthcare, for instance, 
    analyzing vaccination coverage provides actionable insights that can influence public health policies, resource allocation, and community outreach programs. 
    Data science is not just about building models or computing statistics; it is about deriving knowledge that can lead to real-world impact. 
    Through this tutorial, I also learned how data science methodologies can be applied in different sectors, illustrating the versatility and relevance of 
    data-driven approaches in solving practical problems.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, this tutorial offers a holistic view of the data science lifecycle, from data collection to result interpretation. 
    Even though the outcomes of the analysis may vary or have limitations due to the dataset size, structure, or quality, the learning gained is invaluable. 
    It provides a foundation for further exploration, experimentation, and application of data science techniques in both academic and professional settings. 
    By completing this exercise, I now have a deeper appreciation of the iterative and structured approach required in data science projects, 
    and I am better prepared to apply these skills to future datasets and research questions.

<section id="data-collection">
    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>

    <p>
        The first and most essential step in any data science project is <strong>Data Collection</strong>. 
        The quality, completeness, and relevance of the data directly influence the accuracy, reliability, 
        and overall usefulness of the insights we can derive. Depending on the nature of the project, 
        data may originate from several different sources, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Web scraping from publicly accessible websites or portals.</li>
        <li>Downloading datasets from trusted repositories, open data platforms, or government databases.</li>
        <li>Data generated from internal systems, experiments, surveys, or simulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For this project, the dataset was obtained directly from the 
        <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. 
        The dataset focuses specifically on <strong>vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the United States</strong>. 
        Since it is well-organized and contains a substantial number of observations across multiple years, states, 
        and demographic categories, it provides a strong foundation for meaningful analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Effective data collection is not just about acquiring large datasets—what matters most is that the data is 
        <strong>relevant, complete, and reliable</strong>. A well-collected dataset forms the basis for subsequent 
        stages of the data science lifecycle, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and interpretation.
    </p>

    <h3>Importing Python Libraries</h3>
    <p>
        After acquiring the dataset, the next step is to import the essential Python libraries. 
        Python provides a powerful ecosystem for data science, offering libraries for data manipulation, visualization, 
        and machine learning. The following image shows the key libraries imported for this project:
    </p>
    <img src="Untitled.png" alt="Library Imports" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">

    <h3>Download and Import the Data</h3>
    <p>
        Once the CSV file has been downloaded from the CDC platform, it should be placed in the same directory as your 
        Python script or Jupyter Notebook. This ensures that the file can be easily accessed and loaded into a pandas DataFrame 
        for analysis.
    </p>
    <img src="Untitled1.png" alt="Data Loading" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">

    <h3>Understanding the Data</h3>
    <p>
        Before performing any transformations or analysis, it is important to first understand the structure of the dataset. 
        Each row represents a single observation, while each column corresponds to a specific variable, such as year, state, 
        demographic group, or vaccination estimate. Exploring the dataset ensures that decisions in later stages—such as cleaning, 
        modeling, or interpreting results—are based on a solid understanding of the underlying data.

<section id="data-cleaning">
    <h2>3. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

    <p>
        After loading the dataset, the next stage involved cleaning the data and performing exploratory analysis. 
        Raw data is often incomplete, inconsistent, or difficult to analyze in its original form. Cleaning ensures 
        reliable analysis and accurate insights.
    </p>

    <p>Data cleaning included the following key steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Identifying Missing and Inconsistent Data:</strong> 
            Columns like <em>Sample Size</em> and <em>Coverage Estimate</em> had missing values, while <em>95% CI</em> 
            contained non-numeric values like <strong>NR</strong> and <strong>NR*</strong>.
            <img src="Untitled3.png" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">
            <img src="Untitled4.png" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">
            <img src="Untitled5.png" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Renaming Columns for Better Readability:</strong> Some column names were long or unclear, so they were renamed.
            <img src="Untitled6.png" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Handling Missing Values with Median Imputation:</strong> Median was used to fill missing values due to its robustness to outliers.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Sample Size</em> missing values filled with median.
                    <img src="Untitled7.png" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Coverage Estimate</em> missing values filled with median.
                    <img src="Untitled8.png" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Dropping Invalid Confidence Interval Rows:</strong> Rows with <strong>NR</strong> or <strong>NR*</strong> in <em>95% CI</em> were removed.
            <img src="Untitled9.png" style="display:block; margin:20px auto;">
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        EDA helps uncover patterns, detect inconsistencies, compare demographic groups, and identify factors influencing vaccination behavior. 
        These insights guide modeling and interpretation.
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Overview and Summary Statistics</h3>

<section id="model-training">
    <h2>4. Model Training and Testing</h2>
    <p>
        After completing the data cleaning and exploratory analysis, the next step in the data science workflow 
        involved building predictive models to estimate vaccination coverage. 
        The objective of this stage was to determine whether vaccination rates among pregnant women can be 
        predicted using demographic, geographic, and temporal variables such as vaccine type, state, age group, 
        and survey year.
    </p>
    

    <h3>Data Preparation for Modeling</h3>
    <p>
        Since machine learning models require numerical values, all categorical columns 
        (such as <em>VACCINE</em>, <em>GEOGRAPHY</em>, <em>DIMENSION</em>, etc.) 
        were converted into numerical labels using <strong>Label Encoding</strong>. 
        This transformed the dataset into a form that could be processed by machine learning algorithms 
        without losing the underlying categorical relationships.
    </p>
     <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled23.png">
    </div>

    <p>
        The input features included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>VACCINE</strong> (Influenza or Tdap)</li>
        <li><strong>GEOGRAPHY</strong> (State/National)</li>
        <li><strong>GEOGRAPHY-TYPE</strong></li>
        <li><strong>DIMENSION-TYPE</strong> (Age or Race/Ethnicity)</li>
        <li><strong>DIMENSION</strong> (Specific age group or demographic group)</li>
        <li><strong>SURVEY-YEAR</strong> (2012–2022)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The target variable was the <strong>ESTIMATE</strong>, 
        which represents the vaccination coverage percentage.
    </p>
 <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled24.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        The dataset was then split into <strong>80% training data</strong> and 
        <strong>20% testing data</strong> using the <em>train_test_split</em> method. 
        This ensured fair evaluation by training the model on one portion of the data and testing it on unseen values.
    </p>
     <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled25.png">
    </div>

    <h3>Model 1: Linear Regression</h3>
    <p>
        The first model applied was a <strong>Linear Regression</strong> model. 
        This simple model attempts to describe the relationship between predictors and vaccination coverage 
        through a straight-line equation. 
        While linear models are easy to interpret, they may not fully capture complex nonlinear relationships 
        present in public health data.
    </p>
     <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled26.png">
    </div>

    <p>The Linear Regression model produced the following performance metrics:</p>
    <ul>
         <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled27.png">
    </div>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Model 2: Random Forest Regressor</h3>
    <p>
        To improve predictive performance, a <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong> 
        was trained. This model uses multiple decision trees and combines their outputs, 
        making it capable of capturing complex patterns, nonlinear interactions, 
        and variations in the dataset.
    </p>

    <p>The Random Forest model achieved significantly better results:</p>
    <ul>
       <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="Untitled28.png">
    </div>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These metrics indicate that the Random Forest model explains approximately 
        <strong>80% of the variation</strong> in vaccination coverage data, 
        making it a strong predictive model compared to Linear Regression. 
        The model successfully leveraged demographic, geographic, and temporal factors 
        to produce more accurate predictions.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="interpretation">
    <h2>5. Interpretation of Results</h2>
    <p>
        The results obtained from the two machine learning models provide important insights into the 
        predictability of vaccination coverage among pregnant women. By examining the performance metrics 
        and comparing both models, we can understand how well different demographic and geographic factors 
        contribute to predicting vaccination rates.
    </p>

    <h3>Model Performance Comparison</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>Linear Regression</strong> model delivered modest performance, with an R² score of 0.27. 
        This indicates that the linear model could only explain about 27% of the variance in vaccination coverage. 
        The relatively high MAE value (9.79) suggests that its predictions deviated from the actual coverage values 
        by nearly 10 percentage points on average. 
        This outcome reflects the limitations of linear models when the data contains nonlinear interactions, 
        such as varying demographic patterns and state-specific differences.
    </p>

    <p>
        In contrast, the <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong> demonstrated much stronger predictive capability. 
        With an R² score of 0.80, the model was able to explain 80% of the variability in the dataset, 
        showing that vaccination rates can be predicted effectively using factors such as demographic group, 
        vaccine type, and survey year. The MAE dropped to 5.11, meaning predictions were much closer to the 
        actual values.
    </p>

    <h3>Insights from the Modeling Process</h3>
    <p>
        Several meaningful insights emerge from these results:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Vaccination coverage is influenced by demographic and geographic factors.</strong><br>
            Differences between age groups, racial/ethnic groups, and states contribute significantly to the model’s predictive ability.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Year-to-year changes matter.</strong><br>
            The survey year has predictive power, likely due to policy changes, awareness campaigns, and 
            public health interventions over time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Nonlinear models capture complex patterns better.</strong><br>
            The large difference between Linear Regression and Random Forest performance shows that vaccination behavior 
            is not linear and requires more flexible modeling techniques.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overall Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
        The modeling results demonstrate that vaccination coverage among pregnant women can be 
        predicted with relatively high accuracy using key variables in the dataset. 
        The Random Forest model, in particular, highlights the strong influence of demographic factors 
        and geographic differences on vaccination behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        These findings emphasize how machine learning can support public health planning by identifying 
        which groups may need more targeted communication, outreach, or vaccination programs. 
        Although no predictive model is perfect, the results indicate that data-driven approaches 
        can effectively guide decision-making in maternal health and vaccination initiatives.
    </p>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        While our predictive models were not perfect, they provided meaningful insights into vaccination 
        coverage among pregnant women in the United States. Through this project, we were able to uncover 
        patterns in the data, clean and prepare the dataset, visualize important trends, test hypotheses, 
        and build models capable of estimating vaccination rates based on demographic and geographic factors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the Random Forest model performed well, we are not yet ready to recommend any major public 
        health decisions solely based on these predictions. Instead, the results highlight areas for further 
        exploration and point toward the need for additional data and more advanced modeling techniques.
    </p>
