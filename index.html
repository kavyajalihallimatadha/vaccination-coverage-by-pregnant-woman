    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different stages in the data science lifecycle. 
        Data science is a structured process that allows us to extract meaningful insights from data, and this tutorial focuses on four key stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Model Analysis</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation of Results</strong> </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    The overall aim of this data science cycle is to collect data, identify demands and trends, conduct exploratory data analysis, 
    and interpret the findings. While the results of this tutorial may not be fully conclusive, the process provides a clear understanding 
    of how data science works in practice. It also highlights the critical role that data science plays across various sectors, including healthcare, 
    industries, finance, and more. Data-driven decision-making has become a cornerstone in modern industries, and understanding how to handle, analyze, 
    and visualize data effectively is a crucial skill for any aspiring data scientist.
</p>
<p>
    For this tutorial, I have chosen a dataset from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. The dataset focuses on vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the United States. 
    Vaccination during pregnancy is an important public health concern, as it helps protect both the mother and the baby from preventable diseases. 
    Analyzing this dataset allows us to understand patterns of vaccine uptake, explore disparities across different age groups and ethnicities, 
    and identify states or regions where coverage may be lower. These insights can help public health professionals and policymakers design 
    interventions to improve vaccination rates.
</p>
<p>
    By working with this dataset, I aim to gain hands-on experience with real-world data. The process involves handling raw data that may contain 
    inconsistencies, missing values, or different formats, which is typical in practical data science projects. This tutorial demonstrates how 
    cleaning and preprocessing are essential to prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring that the results are accurate and meaningful. 
    Additionally, performing exploratory data analysis and visualizations helps to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers that might otherwise 
    go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the technical aspects, this exercise emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of the data. In healthcare, for instance, 
    analyzing vaccination coverage provides actionable insights that can influence public health policies, resource allocation, and community outreach programs. 
    Data science is not just about building models or computing statistics; it is about deriving knowledge that can lead to real-world impact. 
    Through this tutorial, I also learned how data science methodologies can be applied in different sectors, illustrating the versatility and relevance of 
    data-driven approaches in solving practical problems.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, this tutorial offers a holistic view of the data science lifecycle, from data collection to result interpretation. 
    Even though the outcomes of the analysis may vary or have limitations due to the dataset size, structure, or quality, the learning gained is invaluable. 
    It provides a foundation for further exploration, experimentation, and application of data science techniques in both academic and professional settings. 
    By completing this exercise, I now have a deeper appreciation of the iterative and structured approach required in data science projects, 
    and I am better prepared to apply these skills to future datasets and research questions.

<section id="data-collection">
    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The first and essential step in any data science project is Data Collection. The quality and volume of the data we work with 
        directly influence the accuracy and usefulness of the results. Data can be collected from a variety of sources depending on the project 
        requirements. Common sources include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web scraping from publicly available websites or portals.</li>
        <li>Downloading datasets from reliable repositories, open data platforms, or government databases.</li>
        <li>Data generated from internal systems, experiments, or code simulations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For this tutorial, I have chosen to download the dataset and load it from my local system. The dataset focuses on vaccination coverage among pregnant 
        women in the United States and was obtained from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data" target="_blank">
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. By using a dataset that is well-structured and has a satisfactory volume of data, 
        we can ensure that the subsequent analysis and modeling will yield meaningful insights. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Collecting a good dataset is not just about the number of records but also about its completeness, relevance, and reliability. A well-collected 
        dataset forms the foundation for the next stages in the data science lifecycle, including data processing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.
    </p>

    <h3>Importing Python Libraries</h3>
    <p>
        Once the dataset is available, the next step is to import the necessary Python libraries. Python provides a rich ecosystem of libraries 
        that enable us to efficiently process, analyze, and visualize data. Some of the key libraries that will be used include:

<section id="data-cleaning">
    <h2>3. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

    <p>
        Once the dataset was successfully loaded, the next stage in the data science lifecycle involved cleaning the data and performing exploratory analysis. 
        Data cleaning is an essential part of any data project because raw data is often incomplete, inconsistent, or difficult to analyze in its original form. 
        Cleaning the data prepares it for reliable analysis and ensures that any insights or predictions derived from it are accurate and meaningful.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data cleaning usually involves several tasks, such as removing unnecessary information, handling missing values, fixing formatting issues, 
        and transforming variables into formats that are easier to work with. In this project, the data cleaning process consisted of the following key steps:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Identifying Missing and Inconsistent Data:</strong><br>
            The dataset contained missing values in columns such as <em>Sample Size</em> and <em>Coverage Estimate</em>.  
            The <em>95% CI</em> column also had non-numeric values like <strong>NR</strong> and <strong>NR*</strong>.
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="Untitled3.png" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;">
                <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"</p>
            </div>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="Untitled4.png" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;">
                <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"</p>
            </div>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="Untitled5.png" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;">
                <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Renaming Columns for Better Readability:</strong><br>
            Some column names were long or unclear, so they were renamed to more readable labels.
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="Untitled6.png" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;">
                <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Handling Missing Values with Median Imputation:</strong><br>
            The <strong>median</strong> was used to fill missing values because it is more robust to outliers.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Sample Size</em> missing values were filled with the median.
                    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                        <img src="Untitled7.png" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;">
                        <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"</p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <em>Coverage Estimate</em> missing values were also filled using the median.
                    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                        <img src="Untitled8.png" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;">
                        <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Dropping Invalid Confidence Interval Rows:</strong><br>
            Rows with <strong>NR</strong> or <strong>NR*</strong> in the <em>95% CI</em> column were removed.
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="Untitled9.png" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;">

            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then performed to identify trends, distributions, and relationships within the dataset. 
        This helped build a deeper understanding of the factors influencing vaccination coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the dataset was cleaned, the next step was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
        EDA helps us understand the underlying structure of the data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, 
        and gain insights that guide later modeling decisions. This stage allows us to visually and statistically explore 
        how different variables behave and relate to one another.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary Statistics</h3>
    <p>
        The summary statistics provided an overview of the dataset, including distributions, counts, and central tendencies 
        for both numerical and categorical variables. The dataset contains <strong>4,322 records</strong> across different years, states, 
        and demographic groups. Two vaccines are included — <strong>Influenza</strong> and <strong>Tdap</strong>. The survey spans from 
        <strong>2012 to 2022</strong>, giving a wide range for trend analysis.
    </p>

        <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;">Figure: Summary Statistics Output</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Vaccine Distribution</h3>
    <p>
        A value count of the <strong>VACCINE</strong> column showed that Influenza records (2,865 entries) are almost double compared to 
        Tdap records (1,457 entries). This highlights greater emphasis and availability of influenza vaccination data.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Demographic Dimension Distribution</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset includes two major demographic dimension types: <strong>Age</strong> and <strong>Race/Ethnicity</strong>. 
        The most common categories include 25–34 Years, ≥18 Years, White Non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and Black Non-Hispanic. 
        This wide representation allows meaningful comparison between demographic groups.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Vaccination Estimate Comparisons</h3>
    <p>
        Boxplots were used to compare coverage estimates between vaccine types and demographic dimensions. 
        Influenza coverage appears generally higher and more consistent than Tdap coverage. 
        Age-based comparisons reveal that some age groups (especially 25–34 Years) tend to have higher vaccination rates.
    </p>

    

   

    <h3>Age Group Vaccination Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        A focused analysis on age groups showed noticeable differences across the categories. 
        The <strong>25–34 Years</strong> group generally displayed higher vaccination coverage, while the <strong>18–24 Years</strong> group 
        tended to have lower averages. These patterns can help public health authorities target specific demographic groups for awareness campaigns.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Coverage Trends Over Time</h3>
    <p>
        A line plot of vaccination estimates from 2012 to 2022 revealed an upward trend in vaccination coverage for both Influenza and Tdap. 
        Coverage increases steadily until around 2019, after which minor fluctuations appear in the following years. 
        This long-term trend suggests improved awareness and accessibility of maternal vaccination programs.

    </div>

    <h3>Top 5 States by Data Availability</h3>
    <p>
        The five states with the highest number of records (excluding national data) were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wisconsin</li>
        <li>Delaware</li>
        <li>Pennsylvania</li>
        <li>NY–City of New York</li>
        <li>Missouri</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These states were analyzed in more detail to examine state-specific vaccination patterns and trends.
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
